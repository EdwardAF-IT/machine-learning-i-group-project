We feel that being able to classify arrest type could help in prioritizing dispatch calls, especially when there are more calls than officers available to respond. We assume that arrest type is an indicator of the severity of the incident. It is also worth noting that most of the data available for the classification would be available to the dispatcher. For example, someone placing a call to 911 would most likely have a basic description of the offender such as gender, approximate age and ethnicity. The caller would also know the location of the incident. \n",

    "We will measure effectiveness of our classification model by looking at accuracy. Arrest type has 4 distinct values, indicating a 25% chance of picking the correct arrest type at random. A successful model ideally would exceed the ability of a dispatcher to correctly identify the arrest type. Since we do not have data available for this, we will use 25% as the cut-off for identifying if the model is successful."
