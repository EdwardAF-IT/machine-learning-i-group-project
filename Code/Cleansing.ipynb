We assume that arrest type is an indicator of the severity of the incident. It is also worth noting that most of the data available for the classification would be available to the dispatcher. For example, someone placing a call to 911 would most likely have a basic description of the offender such as gender, approximate age and ethnicity.

    "Most types of arrests trend downwards each year except for infractions, which start to rise around 2013. Misdemeanors decrease consistently, while felonies level off around 2015. Additional research could be done into the socio-political changes surrounding law enforcement over time to determine the effectiveness, or lack thereof, of various ordnances/propositions/laws (prop 47 2015?)\n"
