    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project our group will continue to use the Los Angeles arrest incidents dataset with arrest incidents dating back to 2010, which can be found [here](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Arrest-Data-from-2010-to-Present/yru6-6re4). This dataset contains information about the date, time and location of the incident, demographic data of the person arrested, and information about the type of incident. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be classifying the variables `Arrest Type` (Felony, Misdemeanor, Infraction, Other) and `Descent Code` (Black, Hispanic, White, Other). We feel that being able to classify arrest type could help in prioritizing dispatch calls, especially when there are more calls than officers available to respond. We assume that arrest type is an indicator of the severity of the incident. It is also worth noting that most of the data available for the classification would be available to the dispatcher. For example, someone placing a call to 911 would most likely have a basic description of the offender such as gender, approximate age and ethnicity. The caller would also know the location of the incident and have a brief description of the situation. \n",
    "\n",
    "As far as classifying `Descent Code`, we are not trying to make any political statements. However, if this variable can be predicted, what can that tell us? Any information discovered from this could be invetigated further. The information could be used for community outreach programs to help guide and direct efforts where they will make the most impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "We 10-fold cross validation to test a variety of models. We also adjust model parameters to fine-tune our classification models. \n",
    "\n",
    "Model effectiveness will be measured using accuracy. A successful model would ideally exceed the ability of a dispatcher to correctly identify the arrest type. However, we do not have data available for this. To be considered effective, the model should significantly outperform random chance (25%), so we will use accuracy of 75% as the cut-off for identifying if the model is successful.\n",
    "\n",

The area under the ROC curve measures the two-dimensional area under the ROC curve and is given by the integral of the curve, or the area under the curve (AUC): $$AUC = \\int_{0}^{1}TPR(x)dx = \\int_{0}^{1}P(A>\\tau (x))dx$$\n",

A straight diagonal line beginning at 0 on the bottom left and ending at 1 on the top right indicates a naive model (random guessing). Other metrics such as accuracy are not the best metric for data with imbalanced classes. The Los Angeles City Arrest dataset is imbalanced. \n",

    "Felonies were about 33% of the total dataset, Misdemeanors 62%, Infractions and Other making up the remaining 5%. Higher accuracy on the categorization of the smaller populations may also be more accurate due to lack of overlap on charge codes. There are many charge codes, such as Charge_5 (Burglary), which are exclusively Felonies or Misdemeanors, with absolutely no Infractions or lesser charges. Only 9 of the possible 30 charges contain arrest labeled as Infractions, and those that do rarely also contain Felonies. Because of this, when using charge codes as an element of logistic regression, we can think of certain charge codes as highly indicative of an infraction or lesser charge because they exist in a fairly distinct space relative to the rest of the data that consists of arrests labeled as Felonies and Misdemeanors. This is further supported by the distribution of predictions for Felonies and Misdemeanors. In each column of the confusion matrix, most incorrect classifications for Felonies and Misdemeanors were Misdemeanors and Felonies, respectively. Compared to the small amount of either more serious arrest type that were classified as Infractions or Other, it seems that Felonies and Misdemeanors have more in common with each other than they do with the lesser charges.\n",

    "The support vectors show a generally reduced density and a flattening of the curve for each type of arrest code. Please note that the plot scales vary slightly; this can give the impression that some densities are greater when that is usually not the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another interesting thing to note is that the separation between the distributions in the support vectors is not as great as between the orignal data. This is because support vectors tend to be along the boundaries between clusters, and they can also be affected by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The support vectors revealed that certain charge codes were highly predictive in determing what the arrest code would be.  This is what you might expect given that if someone is arrested for, say, murder, the resulting classification would, of course, be a felony.  Other features did not provide nearly as much insight, at least as far as the support vectors are concerned.  These include such things as the age, area, and various time-related features, which is a somewhat surprising result.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support vector and gradient descent resulted in very similar accuracy, which was also a surprise.  We thought that support vectors would beat gradient descent easily, but this was not the case here.  It may be true in other instances, however, so it would be best to always check both types as well as looking at the various types of SVM kernels to identify the most appropriate model to use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to in the logistic regression model, there were several variables that we thought would be of more importance such as descent, gender and age. Instead we found that `Charge Group Code` and `Area ID` variables have the highest importance."
